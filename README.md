# Title
InstaInstagram and SynAntMatch.

# --Purpose--
This is a REACT application project for Mod 2 PerScholas
The goal is to make a REACT website while implementing API's
I had trouble coming up with a theme for the project, so I just through together the first two ideas i had

# --Instructions--
## InstaInstagram
The point of this section of the site is to help influencers generate instagram like content faster.
You type in a simple sentence, press "Smartify", then with some API magic, a smarter sentence is dispensed...maybe.
Hey, if you don't like the sentence, simply hit the reset button and try again.
Once you get a sentence that you actually like, you can pair it with a random image for it to be social media ready.

## SynAntMatch
This is a game where you are given a random word and a list of both synonyms and antonyms to select from.
You are then given a random number of antonyms and/or synonyms to match.  Only up to 3 though.
You also have a 30 second timer to select your answers, so don't dilly dally!

# --Known Issues--
- There are some issues sometimes with the SyntAntMatch game where an option, or multiple options will be blank
- There may be an issue with certain screen sizes, such as laptops and other smaller screens, see stretch goals
- Styling
    - I know, it's just flat out bad

# --Stretch Goals--
- Have the screen size be fully reactive to fit any/most screen sizes
- Have a check to make sure that an answer is always filled in SynAntMatch
- Better styling
